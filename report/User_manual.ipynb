    "### 1.1 Environment Prerequisite\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run $\\textit{MC-AIXI-CTW}$ agents, the python compiler and standard python library is required.\n",

    "### 1.2  Getting  & Running the  Code\n",
    "\n",
    "Download and extract the $\\href{https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/u6797423/mc-aixi-ctw_implementation}{file}$, in order to run the code, using the commend below in terminal.\n",

    "$\\textit{python aixi.py -e coin flip}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we provided a python script to run the agent within different configurations file, also the visualization of performance change is provided. And it will be talked in next section.\n",

    "# 2. Design own configure file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The configure file is composed by key value pairs, and each pairs occupy a line.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{key = value}$\n",

    "In order to run the agent with custom configure file, parse the commend below in terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textit{python aixi.py -v file.conf }$\n",

    "In order to swap between different environment, parse the commend below in terminal. The s short for second environment, and can be used as -s< second enviroment time >, time to change\n",

    "There options for configure files are below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ct-depth:** maximum depth of the context tree used for prediction.\n",
    "- **agent-horizon:** the number of percept/action pairs to look forward.    \n",
    "- **exploration:** probability of playing a random move.\n",
    "- **explore-decay:** a value between 0.0 and 1.0 that defines the geometric decay\n",
    "of the exploration rate.\n",
    "- **terminate-age:** how many agent/environment cycles before the agent needs to finish.\n",
    "- **mc-simulations:** the number of MC simulations per cycle.\n",
    "- **environment:** the environment the agent is to interact with.\n",
    "- **learning-period:** the cycle count.\n",
    "- **second:**  the second enviroment to run, you may need to swap between environments.Please follow the formats below to specify the parameter <br> -s <name of second enviroment,time to run second environment>\n",

    "- **experimental_result:** The folder to store the experimental result. The script will create it if there doesn't existes one. And, all information is stored as log file.  \n",
    "- **conf_director:** The folder contains the different configure files. Only the file endup with \".conf\" will be experimented.\n",
    "- **performance_inrease_graph:** Reading the specifed log file, and generate a single graph about reward. The format for setting the parameter is <br> < log file >$\\text{~}$<'title of the graph'>  \n",
    "- **interval_performance_inrease_graph:** Reading the specifed log file, and generate a single smoothed graph about the average reward. The interval can be set by using interval parameter. And, the format for setting the parameter is <br>  < log file >$\\text{~}$<'title of the graph'>\n",
    "- **compare_performance_graph:** By supplying the director, it will reading a list of log file. Then, generate the graph for them. The format to giving the value is <br>  < where store the log files >$\\text{~}$<\"['name of labels',]\">$\\text{~}$<'title of graph'>. <br>  Be careful, the order for the name of labels need to corresponds with the alphabeta order of log files.\n",
    "- **custom_name:** The log file for different configure files wil be stored as the name of configure file plus the custom_name. if no custom name is supplied, the current time will be considered as custom name. \n",
    "- **interval:** In order to smooth the history reward, the interval need to be supplied. The default value will be 50.\n",
    "- **type of reward:** Used to indicate whether we should read average reward or reward from the log file.\n",
